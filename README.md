# Admin App for Online Survey

Admin app for [Suvey-Online] using [NG6-starter] as starting point.

## Dependencies
Tools needed to run this app:
* `node` and `npm`
Once you have these, install the following as globals:  
`npm install -g gulp karma karma-cli webpack`

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install -g gulp karma karma-cli webpack` install global cli dependencies
* `npm install` to install dependencies

## Running the App
NG6 uses Gulp to build and launch the development environment. After you have installed all dependencies, you may run the app. Running `gulp` will bundle the app with `webpack`, launch a development server, and watch all files. The port will be displayed in the terminal.

### Tech

This app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Webpack] - A bundler for javascript
* [gentelella] - Bootstrap 3 Admin Template
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [jQuery] - for some reason


For more development detail see [NG6-starter]
